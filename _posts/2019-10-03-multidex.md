Being an Android developer , You will always find yourself surrounded with hell lot of unknown errors. And overcome such errors to deliver things on time become your worst nightmare.

Idea to cover such issues come to me when I was stuck with some uncommon problem just before few hours of deadline.

* This article is centered around below mentioned tools
- Android Studio 1.5.1
- Gradle V 1.5.0
- Build tool version 23.0.2

When application uses multiple third party SDK or library projects , It start producing multi dex errors.In order to overcome this situation follow below step.

Things to add in your build.gradle file under your app module.

{% highlight gradle %}
android {
....
//Add below line under android{}, in build.gradle file of your app module.
dexOptions {
    javaMaxHeapSize "4g"
}
....
}
{% endhighlight %}

Compile below statement in build.gradle file in app module

{% highlight gradle %}
dependencies {

    compile 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.1'
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you app contains Application.class , Then you need to apply below mentioned modification to your Application.class

{% highlight java %}
public class AppController extends MultiDexApplication {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {

        super.onCreate();

    }

    @Override
    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base);
        MultiDex.install(AppController.this);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now your app is ready to handle Multidex. :-)
